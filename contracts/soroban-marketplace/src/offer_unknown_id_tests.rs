// offer_unknown_id_tests.rs — Issue 078 (offer withdrawal for unknown identifier)
//
// Offer withdrawal for an unknown identifier should have defined, deterministic
// behavior. These tests pin the current policy so any regression is immediately
// visible.
//
// Acceptance criteria:
//   • Withdrawing with an unused offer_id returns `OfferNotFound` (#16).
//   • No offer or balance state changes after the failed withdrawal.
//   • The test follows existing error-code conventions (Error(Contract, #N)).
